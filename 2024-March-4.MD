Zhouchu Eliminating Three Evils: A Tale of Transformation

Zhouchu Eliminating Three Evils is a popular folklore tale in the collection Shi Shuo Xin Yu. It is well-known among the Chinese people.

Zhouchu was a historical figure recorded in the Book of Jin. His family was one of the most renowned in Southeast China.

However, as time passed, Zhouchu's family had fallen from grace for generations. By the time he was born, he lacked any distinguished achievements except for his exceptional strength and the loyalty of his brothers.

During his youth, Zhouchu was a mischievous and rebellious boy. He was not well-liked by his neighbors and villagers. They, including his own uncles, considered him a troublemaker and a constant source of annoyance.

One day, while walking down the street with his brothers, Zhouchu encountered a venerable old man with white hair and beard who was preaching in the marketplace.

Drawn to the man's wise demeanor, Zhouchu approached him and inquired, "Master, who are you? And why have you come here?"

"Greetings, young man," the old man replied, "I am a wandering sage, and I have come here specifically for you. The divine realm has revealed that you are not inherently bad. If you forsake your wicked ways and embrace virtue, you can become a heroic warrior, a loyal official, and a devoted son. Choose the path of righteousness, lest you fall into darkness."

The sage then vanished as quickly as he appeared, leaving Zhouchu and his companions bewildered.

Upon returning home, Zhouchu declared to his mother, "I will mend my ways and become a respectable man." He then sought an audience with the village administrator and said, "Sir, I wish to transform myself from a mere laborer into a noble man. Please guide me on this path."

The administrator responded, "There are three plagues that constantly disturb the peace and well-being of our people. If you can overcome these challenges, you will be hailed as our greatest hero."

"What are these threats?" inquired Zhouchu.

"The first is the ferocious tiger that roams the southern mountain. This beast frequently attacks people and livestock, hindering our access to food and forcing us to restrict travel through the mountains."

"This task presents no difficulty," Zhouchu confidently declared.

Within a few hours, Zhouchu returned with a massive tiger head and several bones, presenting them to the administrator. "This beast will no longer terrorize our village," he proclaimed. "Now, tell me about the second evil."

"It is the fearsome dragon that resides in the Black River. This creature not only attacks those who come to wash clothes by the riverbank, but also causes devastating floods during the summer months."

"This challenge too, presents no great obstacle," Zhouchu declared with unwavering determination.

Similarly, after a few hours, Zhouchu returned, carrying a large object resembling snake skin. "Here is the proof of my success," he declared. "And what is the third evil you mentioned?"

The administrator hesitated, unable to speak, and turned away.

Perplexed, Zhouchu swiftly followed him indoors.

"What is the meaning of your silence? Please speak plainly," Zhouchu pleaded.

The administrator, with a heavy heart, confessed, "Young man, the third evil is you. Your past actions have significantly disrupted the peace and tranquility of our village."

Zhouchu was struck with a profound sense of shame, standing speechless for several moments. Finally, he composed himself and uttered, "I understand. I am deeply ashamed, and I am grateful to you and the villagers for your patience. I will dedicate myself to changing my ways. Please, believe in my sincerity."

From that day forward, Zhouchu remained diligently at home, devoting himself to learning and self-improvement. Two years later, he emerged a transformed man, respected and admired by all.
